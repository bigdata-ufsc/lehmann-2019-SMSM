 * The F-score (or F-measure) considers both the precision and the recall of the test

 * correct positive results divided by the number of positive results that should
 * have been returned.
 *
 * The traditional or balanced F-score (F1 score) is the harmonic mean of
 * precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst at 0.
